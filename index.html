This documentary talks about certain aspects the Internet was used for and portrayed an example of the gulf war in which the United States and its allies had a strategy far stronger than their opponents because of the way they knew how to use the Internet.<br><br>During that time the Internet was treated as a weapon and a race to superiority during the Cold War the Soviets launched a rocket into space in response president Eisenhower created the space program which today we know as NASA. The field of computer science was vital for NASA‘s mission of going to the moon. The Internet also saved the United States and protect it from many disasters such as when the United States feared a possible nuclear attack from the Soviets and was worried that it’s unsophisticated telephone communications system would break down. Dr. Paul Baran the mind behind a newly made communication system Baran used an idea similar to the telegram which divided pieces of information into packets that were delivered across The network to its recipients.</p>

Companies we’re trying to develop things to help regular every day people to navigate the Internet and browser wars were formed Microsoft the leading competitor at the time was among one of those companies. Microsoft was home to young computer scientists of all ages and were very aggressive to competition. One of Microsoft biggest competitors was Netscape, Netscape’s stock price when it shares became publicly traded grew very rapidly in the founder of Netscape was determined to take Microsoft and Bill Gates down.<br><br>In response at the beginning of the year 1995 Microsoft created the most well known World Wide Web application Internet explorer. Bill Gates was determined to ruin Netscape by any means possible even if he had to take some unlawful steps. Microsoft found a way to take down Nick scape offered a free solution to browsing the web compared to the paid application that Netscape provided Microsoft had Internet explorer integrated in their operating system and consumers were ecstatic.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-text">Until now navigating the web was nearly impossible. The Internet had long pages of information and finding what you needed was difficult. This introduced an uproar of young computer science entrepreneurs that founded companies like Yahoo and Excite and made them extremely wealthy in the process. The Internet search first started When Jerry Yang and David Filer, the founders of yahoo wanted to find information about a basketball game.<br><br>The two young entrepreneurs still had no way to generate revenue off of their search engine and to counter that they advertise banners on their website and the advertising companies would pay them for the traffic they produce. This is when yahoo showed everyone but it was possible to make money off of the Internet. This started an Internet search frenzy since people previously thought it was impossible to make money off the web. With the help of Bill Gross, a new company which we now know as the infamous Google, Gross solved the riddle of Internet advertising.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-text">With the new age of Internet search and search engines becoming more advanced and companies advertising their products on the Internet, e-commerce was just getting started. The obsession with shopping became more conspicuous and this was the evolution of capitalism. Companies we know today like Amazon and eBay harness the power of Internet traffic and both companies offered a solution to buying and selling merchandise with ease.

            <br><br>Jeff Bezos the founder of Amazon originally created it to be a bookstore with this new technology also came obstacles like actually purchasing from the website. Customers at first did not trust this new technology because to purchase a product from the website you needed to enter your credit card information which seemed risky to customers because their credit card information could be stolen. To combat this obstacle, Woodfield Diffey, Martin Helman, and Ralph Merkel created a solution called public key cryptography which encrypted the information so customers could share their information confidentially on e-commerce websites.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-text">A system called the domain name system or DNS associates websites with the corresponding address and your computer uses the DNS to look up names and get the associated IP address which is used to connect your computer to the destination on the internet. There is no way one DNS can handle all the requests from all devices. The answer to this problem is DNS servers are connected in a distributed hierarchy and are divided into domains (.com, .net, and, .org.) DNS was originally created to be a public communication protocol for government and educational institutions because of this it was susceptible to attacks like DNS spoofing. That’s when a hacker taps into a DNS server and changes it to a domain name different from the IP addresses and directs you to another website.<br><br></p>

          <h2 class="content-title">Domains</h2>
          <p class="paragraph-text">A domain name itself comprises two elements: before and after “the dot”. The part to the right of the dot, such as “com”, “net”, “org” and so on, is known as a “top-level domain” or TLD. One company in each case (called a registry), is in charge of all domains ending with that particular TLD and has access to a full list of domains directly under that name, as well as the IP addresses with which those names are associated. The part before the dot is the domain name that you register and which is then used to provide online systems such as websites, email and so on. These domains are sold by a large number of “registrars”, free to charge whatever they wish, although in each case they pay a set per-domain fee to the particular registry under whose name the domain is being registered.</p>
          <h2 class="content-title">ICANN</h2>
          <p class="paragraph-text">ICANN was formed in 1998. It is a not-for-profit partnership of people from all over the world dedicated to keeping the Internet secure, stable and interoperable. It promotes competition and develops policy on the Internet’s unique identifiers. ICANN doesn’t control content on the Internet. It cannot stop spam and it doesn’t deal with access to the Internet. But through its coordination role of the Internet’s naming system, it does have an important impact on the expansion and evolution of the Internet.</p>

          <h2 class="content-title">IP Addresses</h2>
          <p class="paragraph-text">Back in the 1970s there were no standard methods for networks to communicate. Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn created this method called the “Internet Networking Protocol” which is what we now call the Internet. The Internet links billions of devices all around the world. All these devices on the Internet have unique addresses. This Internet protocol address (IP address) is what is used to identify a device. An IP address contains specific information in each set of numbers. The earlier set of numbers identify the country and region, then the subnetworks, and finally the address of the device. This design is called IPv4 which was designed in 1973.</p>
          <h2 class="content-title">Packets</h2>
          <p class="paragraph-text">The way information gets transferred from one computer to another is pretty interesting. It does not follow a fixed path, in fact a path may change at any time between a computer to computer conversation. Information on the Internet goes from one computer to another in what we call a packet of information. A packet travels one place to another on the Internet a lot like how you might get from one place to another in a car. Depending on traffic a packet may be forced to take “detours” to get to its destination.</p>
          <h2 class="content-title">Routing</h2>
          <p class="paragraph-text">As part of the internet protocol every router keeps track of multiple paths for sending packets and it chooses the fastest possible path per piece of data based on its destination IP address and the best route for data to travel isn’t necessarily the most direct. Having multiple options for paths is what makes the internet reliable for sending information.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-text">World wide web consortium or W3C is a vendor-neutral organisation created in 1994 that develops common interoperable protocols for the World Wide Web. W3C is primary activity is to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the web. W3C standards define key parts of what makes the World Wide Web. Represented by the Massachusetts Institute of technology in the United States and a number of international research centers, the World Wide Web consortium provides a variety of services to its member organisations including the following: discussion groups and meetings on issues relating to the evolution of the World Wide Web, repositories of information, reference documents, and code relating to WWW protocols services, and applications.</p>
          <h2 class="content-title">HTML</h2>
          <p class="paragraph-text">HTML stands for Hypertext markup language this is the language that you use to tell a web browser how to make a page look. HTML is what are use to make a title on the website big and bold, change fonts, insert images, and reposition different elements on a webpage.</p>
          <h2 class="content-title">CSS</h2>
          <p class="paragraph-text">Modern modern day website is made up of three files: HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. CSS defines the overall appearance and style of a page. CSS is short for cascading style sheet, it helps determine things like colors, fonts, positioning of certain elements and even animation.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-text">When entering a website in that moment your computer starts talking to another computer called a server that is usually thousands of miles away and in milliseconds your computer asks that server for a website and that server starts to talk back to your computer in a language called HTTP. HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol which is a language that one computer uses to ask another computer for a document. HTTP manages the sending and receiving of HTML, media files, or anything on the web. HTTPS which stands for hypertext transfer protocol secure, ensures that your HTTP requests are secure and protected such as when logging into a website.</p>
